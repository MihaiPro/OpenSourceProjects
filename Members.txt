    I'm from Greece and I'm 17 years old. I've been working with Python2 for a bit over a year now.
    I've been looking for some people to work with for some time because doing stuff alone isn't as much fun
    plus we can build much more if we work together. Hope to see many people joining soon.

   I'm from the U.S. I love python and I've been looking for a nice open-source project for a while to devote some time and
   skills to. I'm reggie to see what we can do and what we can build!
   Experience: About a year or so with python, but about 4 years with game development in general. 
   I'm very excited to build stuff with pygame along with other like-minded people!
