    I am from Romania, I am almost 14 years(my birthday: 30.06.2000) and I love programming.
    There are no much things to say about me. I can say: I am ambitious, hardworking and I don't give up 
    fast.
    Experience: 8 months
    I want to work with other people who loves programming and develop good softwares and maybe to make money.

    I'm from Greece and I'm 17 years old. I've been working with Python2 for a bit over a year now.
    I've been looking for some people to work with for some time because doing stuff alone isn't as much fun
    plus we can build much more if we work together. Hope to see many people joining soon.

    I'm from Indonesia. Newbie in programming. Still figuring out what kind of spesific field that suit for me, so I decided to
    start/involve in some projects.
